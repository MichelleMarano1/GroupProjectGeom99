    <h1 class = "title4"> How we did it</h1>
	<p class= homeSubHead> ArcGIS Pro </p>
	<p class = "generalText"> Found language data from Statistics Canada reviewed the data and fixed all of ontario since most of the languages were marked as "undetermined which is not the case. 
		Made map in Arc pro then uploaded it right into Arc Online then finalized the web map to embed into Dashboards.
		 </p>
	<p class = homeSubHead> Dashboards </p>
	<p class="generalText"> Figured out the data we wanted to download and manipulate in ArcGIS Pro was in a REST end point so we took the URL and made the map right in Arc Online. From there with our 3 URLS uploaded into the content, we used the spatial analysis tool to manipulate the data. From there we learned how to author a Dashboard from scratch and how to make the elements talk to each other. We added the necessary elements to a pie graph, charts and lists to communicate our data. </p>
	<p class = homeSubHead> Experience Builder </p>
	<p class="generalText"> To create our experience builder we added a variety of elements including the dashboards that were made previously.  We added more elements in the form of widgets to better tell the story of Indigenous communities in Canada.  The widgets we used included images, text, menus, and buttons. </p>
	<p class = homeSubHead> Configurable Apps </p>
	<p class="generalText"> To create a configurable app we used an existing My Scene Map and edited the data to display the Indigenous population and the European settlement in the years  1630 and 1740.  A configurable app using "Compare" was used to create a Side by Side two scene map </p>
